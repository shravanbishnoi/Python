# Semester1
This GitHub repository is dedicated to storing and managing all the python code related to my Programming Abstraction (Python) course. Throughout my first semester, I will be working on various programming problems and tasks that will be stored here. I cordially invite you to explore the codebase and give your valuable feedback and suggestions. This will help my programming skills to improve and build my fundamentals in python.
These all are self implemented/written, So, please let me know in case you find any bug/ambiguity.

It contains individual python scripts solving some problems for beginners in python.
